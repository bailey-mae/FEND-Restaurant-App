#### Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I added responsive design elements and a service worker for a seamless offline experience.

## Running the Project:

To view the project in the browser, download and install Python. In the terminal window use python -v to check version. If Python version returned above is 3.X
python -m http.server
If Python version returned above is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
View the project by opening localhost:8000 in your browser.
